In order to get part A to work, we had to modify a few different files for the code to start at address 0x2000 instead of 0. This included both makefiles, exec.c, proc.c, and vm.c

For part B we had to modify it a little more. we first started by moving the stack to the top by modifying exec.c and vm.c, and remade the bounds in syscall.c. and tested that. We also made a new variable in the proc struct called stack_ptr in order to keep track of the bottom of the stack. We then moved on to the next set of tests and modified growproc in proc.c to stop the heap from growing into the stack. The last part was to make the stack grow, and for it to not grow into the heap. We did this by making a method in proc.c called growstack, and then calling that when there is a trap. We also modified fork and few other places where the stack pointer needed to be used.
